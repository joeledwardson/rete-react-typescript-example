# Rete React Typescript Example

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Project source is migrated from [Rete.js React render sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/t899c?file=/public/index.html) and converted to use typescript (not strict.)

Intended to serve as a base for rete.js projects using React and Typescript.
